Widget zoomed to maximum size.

The Steampunk-Grid-Gauges widget is an attractive Steampunk Yahoo widget for 
your desktop. It is a series of electrical generation and consumption gauges for 
the UK electricity generating network. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. 
This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the desktop 
as you require.

When you first run the widget it will default to displaying the UK current 
electricity consumption. A right click on the prefs will allow you to select 
data relating to any method of generating or delivering electricity in the UK. It 
can also display the current frequency in Hz.

The graphics are my own. This widget was created with the serious coding skills 
of Harry Whitfield. I supplied the graphics, made some ephemeral changes and 
helped steered the widget toward its final goal. I also tested the widget and added 
a little extra functionality. Harry built the core and did it far better than I 
ever would have.

The above gauge shows coal-power generation by the UK's coal-fired power stations, a real-time 
gauge that takes its information via a real-time feed from powergen, the UK 
national power generating organisation.

For the first time since 1882 the power stations of the UK have run without 
burning any coal at all. The very first power station was set up in 1882 and 
coal-powered power stations have been run continuously ever since. They have 
produced the majority of Britain's electricity over the last 150 years.

Huge efforts by the governments over the recent decades have reduced Britain's 
reliance on coal until it has reached a point where they were able to turn all 
the coal-powered stations off. The above gauge shows just half a gigawatt 
currently being generated by coal but that gauge has been reading zero for 
almost a week. This is Great Britain doing its bit for the environment.

I find this a fascinating bit of information especially as it is a rather 
telling indicator that Britain's industrial revolution, the one powered solely 
by coal is nearly at an end, you could call it the end of a steampunk era... 
the good thing is even the newest nuclear power stations are still producing 
copious amounts of steam!

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide. 

The electrical gauges take their data from this feed:
